# An Introduction to Statistical Learning — Personal Study

This repository contains my personal study of the book  
**_An Introduction to Statistical Learning_**.

It includes exercise solutions implemented in **Python** using **Jupyter Notebooks**, following the chapters of the book. The goal is to better understand statistical learning and machine learning concepts through hands-on practice.

**Tools used:** Python, JupyterLab, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn.
